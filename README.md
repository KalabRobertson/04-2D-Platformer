# 2D-Platformer-Character

A multi-level 2d platformer with some juiciness and features!

## Implementation
In this game I have added the following features:
2 Large Levels, both are elaborate
Different Sprites
Music
Extra Enemies
Parallax Backgrounds
Save and Load features
Score 
Portals to different zones
Controllable player
The camera follows the player
and some others!

Built using Godot 3.2.3

The player sprite is adaptated from [MV Platformer Male](https://opengameart.org/content/mv-platformer-male-32x64) by MoikMellah. CC0 Licensed.
